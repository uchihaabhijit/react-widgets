a) Wikipedia API that lets users search for a topic and display in on the page itself. I have used the Wikipedia Search API to fetch the results. Also, I have implemented the concept of Debouncing which is to delay the execution of API requests in a controlled manner.


b) Weather API that lets users know the forecast for a particular city. I basically create a custom dropdown selection component to understand the concept of Event Bubbling
